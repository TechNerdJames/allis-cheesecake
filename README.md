## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Snipcart, Netlify.

This website was created and built with the goal of allowing customers to view and order my client's cheesecake products directly on the site by integrating Snipcart.

## Optimizations

To improve this project, I will be refactoring my code to make it more efficient as there's a lot that I've learned since finishing this project that I can use to make improvements and changes. I will also be working on the landing page design to make it stand out more.

## Lessons Learned:

I really enjoyed building this website project for my client because it taught me a lot and helped me solidify my fundamental web development technical knowledge and skills and helped me further improve those technical skills especially with CSS. This project  gave me some insight and a bit of experience into freelance work and creating something for your own clients. It was a pleasant experience to build something that will be used to help a business.

By doing research and finding the Snipcart solution to my shopping cart issues, I learned that there are many tools and libraries out there that can even help Front End Developers build almost anything they want even with only a limited knowledge of back end development.
